## About

> Since I was little, I loved to built all kinds of things. Now that I'm just a bit older ðŸ˜‰ I can keep building new things using my laptop.

I started my tech career in IT, a few years later I decided to learn how to code. Programming has inspired me not just to create amazing ideas, and work with other in amazing projects, but also to teach others how to code. I'm a Software Engineer and a Tech instructor who has find a passion for programming and for teaching.
