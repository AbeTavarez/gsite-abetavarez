## About

> Hello 👋🏻 I'm Abraham! I'm a Software Engineer and a Tech instructor 👨🏻‍💻

Being able to create something that can be touch or even change the life of so many people, to me that's the greatest super-power ever! I started my tech career in IT, years later I decided to learn how to code. Since then programming has not only allowed me to work with amazing people in very interesting projects, but also to create my own ideas and bring them to the world. My passion for programming has also inspired me to teach others how to code.
